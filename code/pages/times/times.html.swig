<p>
There are at least two types of time: the one we all know — with past
and future — and another, called present,
the moment when everything is happening.
</p>
<p>
Stephen Hawking showed us the linear time is finite — started about 15bn
years ago and having an end somewhere. And he also says physics — thus
humans in a physical universe — have less sense in a finite spacetime.
</p>
<p>
Physics managed to solve this problem by transforming the finite
spacetime to something infinite like the surface of our planet by
adding a new kind of time, an imaginary one.
</p>
<p>
This imaginary time has a completely different nature and direction
than the real time. It is not about the far past and the far future but
the endless possibilities one has in the present.
</p>
<p>
Imaginary time moves up and down instead of back and forth.
It may be your mood for a given moment.
Your level of spirit at a certain time.
</p>
<p>
It is strange the path physics walked through centuries:
by researching the real life and existence they’ve come to add an
imaginary dimension to the rescue.
